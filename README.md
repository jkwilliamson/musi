<h1>musi</h1>
<p>A small portfolio project that currently calculates intervals in music theory.</p>
<p>I am passionate and self-taught in music theory, so this project has been an interesting way to apply
my knowledge to programming.</p>

<h3>Process</h3>
<ul>
  <li>I spent a decent chunk of time throughout the entire project learning HTML, CSS, and JS as I am most familiar with Java and currently have little experience with web development. I wanted to learn JS first before moving onto React/TypeScript.</li>
  <li>A lot of this project was spent thinking about how to convert notes/intervals to numbers, then identifying patterns in those numbers. Notes present interesting problems since they are cyclical, and not all notes are 1 whole step apart (E → F and B → C). Additionally, accidentals make it possible to have <i>enharmonics</i>—when two notes represent the same frequency but can be written differently to serve a function. This makes it difficult though to just calculate the difference between either the half steps or the base note (with no accidentals). A combination of both is necessary to identify an interval.</li>
  <li>I reached a hurdle when it came to displaying notes, but thanks to VexFlow, I was able to concisely create the note displays I needed.</li>
  <li>I generated mp3 files for each pitch in a defined range (Bb3 to C#6) to play sound feedback for each interval.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Future</h2>
<p>This is the beginning of a larger project in which I would like to have:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Practice questions of variable difficulty
  <li>Triad calculations
  <li>Seventh Chord calculations
  <li>Inversions
  <li>Chord Progressions
</ol>

<p>Thanks for reading!</p>
